The document "path_general.php" will be used to
storage variables that will contain the path
of all folder and files that could be accesed from any part of the web app.

The style guidelines of this file to keep consistency among present and future developers
that may work on this project:

1º All of the folder that are located in the root directory will have as a way of declaring
that all of the folders and files that come after this anuncement are located inside of this
parent folder the text:
    ##START NAME FOLDER
And at the end of it this text:
    ##END NAME FOLDER

2º Inside of it for each folder located there will be as a declaration this line of text:
    //NAME_FOLDER folder
Followed by a variable that will storage the path.

3º After the declaration of the folder name and the variable that will storage the path, for each folder we will have as a way of anuncing that these are the contents of the folder the line of text:
    //Inside NAME_FOLDER
after this line there will be a tabulation for all of the text that will hold the information of wich files and folder are located inside of the parent folder.

4ºEach //Anouncement will be separated by a new line.
The ##START and ##END will not have a line separation to make it easier to diferenciate.

Example of the guidelines if applied correctly.

##START SRC FOLDER
//Src folder
$src = "./src";

//Inside src

    //App folder
    $app = "$src/app";

    //Inside app
        $appAboutme = "$app/about_me.php";
        $appArticles = "$app/articles.php";

    //Components folder
    $components = "$src/components";

    //Data folder
    $data = "$src/data";

    //Features folder
    $features = "$src/features";
